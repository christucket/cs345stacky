// new function labels are

// functions labels can be inside of push statements (and expressions ... i think, i haven't fucking tried and i don't care.
// it doesn't need to have a name but if it does have a name, you can recall it later in the code.

// the code below will keep looping until the last param hits 0

// while (0) means while the last element is >0, if its <=0 it will fail the test condition.
