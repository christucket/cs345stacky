// new function labels are
// func:name:params{body}
// if a function doesn't have (or need) a name, leave it blank if you want
// func::params{body}
// if a function doesn't params (basically 0 extra params), leave it blank if you want
// func:name:{body}
// func::{body}

// functions labels can be inside of push statements (and expressions ... i think, i haven't fucking tried and i don't care.
// it doesn't need to have a name but if it does have a name, you can recall it later in the code.

// expressions will look like ( 0 1 + 1 2 + > ) or something like that, parens don't work so don't bother trying them

// the code below will keep looping until the last param hits 0
// right now the operator order would be something like   X Y -   ==> Y - X, i'm going to change that or you can change it if you want and push your updates, it's fairly easy to do, it's all in function.java

    push(1, 1);
